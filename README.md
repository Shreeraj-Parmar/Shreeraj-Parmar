## ⚡ About Me

I design and build scalable software systems with a focus on reliability, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

Beyond shipping features, I’m deeply interested in understanding the complete execution process —  
how code runs, how processes are managed, how systems communicate, and how infrastructure scales under real-world conditions.

I care about building things the right way — simple, structured, and production-ready.
